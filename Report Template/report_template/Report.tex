\section{Protocol Introduction}
Maximum 2 pages about the theoretical basics of the experiment.

\section{Experimental setup}
The experimental setup, the differences of the experimental series, the different parameters used.

\section{Results and Analsys}
Analyze your data with respect to the aim of the experiment. Your task during the experiment is not just to measure and document your measurements, but to derive and present conclusions from your measurements. If there are some errors in the final results. Investigate and try to understand all types and sources of errors in all your measurements.

\section{Conclusions}
Summarize and discuss your results with respect to the literature or your own scientific expectations. You should in particular discuss possible error sources and give a short judgment on the quality of the experimental setup (because you also learn to design the measurement setups). If needed, suggest how to improve the setups.
